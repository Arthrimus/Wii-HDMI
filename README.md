# Wii-HDMI

Wii HDMI is a variant of the Shuriken V3 GCVIDEO project aimed for installation in Wii consoles. Its form factor is inspired by the now out of production Wii Dual, which was another GCVideo project for the Wii designed by Dan Kunz(citrus3000psi) which had dual output capability providing HDMI and analog output options. 

The Wii HDMI only has HDMI functionality, and can be installed on all models of Wii (except the Wii mini) although it's specifically designed to fit the RVL-CPU-40 RVL-CPU-50 RVL-CPU-60, RVK-CPU-01 RVK-CPU-02, it does have accomodations to allow installation on older Wii motherboard revisions. 

I have designed the mod to work with the same flex cable that Dan designed for the Wii Dual, and I have also drawn up a compatible flex that can be manufactured in the event that Dan no longer has old stock of Wii Dual flexes available. 

This is still a work in progress, but the current diptrace file for the board set, and current gerbers are available in the PCB folder. More info will come soon.
